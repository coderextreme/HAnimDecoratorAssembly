# HAnimDecoratorAssembly

The main thing this provides is a way to add skin coordinate information (weights and indexes) and skeletons to X3D files exported from Blender, via additions in glTF.  view3dscene has on their workplate to provide skeletons and skin coord information in X3DV, but we don't know when.  I am also working on extracting weights and indexes and skeleton directly from Python.  

Under development.  Has been tested on 1 .FBX.  People wanting to convert FBX to X3DV are welcome to contact me, leave anote in issues, etc.

Combine glTF and X3D exports from Blender, along with other sources.

# Required inputs (Provided by you), documentation pending.

lily_73/lily_73.gltf (as exported by Blender, be sure to include normals)
lily_73/lily_73.x3d (as exported by Blender, be sure to include normals)

./InputDir73/7_3 joint location.txt
./InputDir73/7_3_WEIGHTS.txt

Note that the first model I worked with there were "patchups" required to the .x3dv file at the last step.  One is introduced, Shape, I think, the others are because the X3D and glTF have different DEF values for Coordinate and Normal.  See patchup*.pl


The main program is convertLily.sh or convertGramps.sh

Here's the basic workflow now, very simple.  I'm open to name changes now.  You may toggle validation between 0 and 1, which will improve performance if validation is disabled.

< means reading from file after.
> means writing to file after
${PREFIX} is a folder plus file prefix.

I'll be looking at bringing over animations pretty soon.

The below is old.
